<h1>Hello, I am KoleckOLP or Andrew.</h1>
<p>
I am a hobbyist programmer, and a pretty lazy one at that.<br>
Coding in Python and C#, would like to get better at QBasic and AutoHotKey.<br>
My hobby is testing operating systems, Windows, Linux, Mac, HaikuOS, freeBSD, Android.<br>
I also like reverse engeneering, reviving and archiving old software and games.<br>
