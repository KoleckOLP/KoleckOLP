<h1>Hewwo ❤️, I'm KoleckOLP or Andrew.</h1>
<p>
I write bad code that even works sometimes!<br>
Mostly working on yt-dl, should uppload old code soon™.<br>
Rewriting old projects because I have no inspiration to make new ones.<br>
My biggest passison is supporting as many sperating systems as I can,<br>
with minimum effort(because I'm lazy), curently supporting:<br>
Windows, Linux, MacOS, BSD, HaikuOS, Android<br>
Definitely no shady business here ;)<br>
don't check out my webpage, link not in the bio<br>
