<h1>Hewwo ❤️, I'm KoleckOLP or Andrew.</h1>
<p>
I write bad code that even works sometimes!<br>
Mostly working on yt-dl, I love python 3 and C# <3.<br>
My biggest passison is supporting as many sperating systems as I can,<br>
with minimum effort(because I'm lazy), considered platforms:
Windows, Linux, MacOS, HaikuOS, BSD, Solaris, Android, PS Vita<br>
Definitely no shady business here ;)<br>
don't check out my webpage, link in the bio<br>
